**AirPure Innovations – Market Fit Research (Codebasics Resume Challenge 16)**

This repository contains my submission for Codebasics Resume Project Challenge 16, focused on analyzing India's air pollution crisis and identifying the product-market fit for AirPure Innovations, a hypothetical startup in the air purification industry.

The project combines data analysis, visualization, and research to provide actionable insights for stakeholders and decision-makers.

**Project Overview:**

India ranks among the most polluted countries globally, with 14 cities in the top 20 most polluted. AirPure Innovations aimed to understand the market potential before investing in production and R&D.

This project addressed that need by building a data-driven dashboard and conducting research analytics to uncover:

Key pollutants driving health risks

Geographic hotspots for product launch

Policy and market dynamics affecting air purifier adoption

Demand surges during seasonal pollution spikes

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................

**Deliverables:**

Video Presentation

Live Dashboard

Product Requirement & Development Document

Research Findings (Presentation PDF)

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................
**Dashboard Highlights:**

Home Page: Project introduction and overview

AQI: Air quality trends across regions

Polluscope: Pollution and its impact on health

Market: Current market landscape for air purifiers

Summary Pages: Concise insights for quick stakeholder decision-making

**Key Insights:**

PM10 & PM2.5 are the most harmful pollutants — filtration must prioritize these.

Population is not proportional to pollution — Bengaluru shows the importance of strong policies.

Smaller regions like Byrnihat (Meghalaya-Assam border) face severe pollution, often overlooked.

High-risk launch hotspots: Delhi, Noida, Gurugram, Patna.

Children and seniors face the worst health risks (asthma, COPD, bronchitis).

EV adoption shows mixed results — not a guaranteed solution to clean air.

Awareness of AQI exists, but understanding is low in Tier 2/3 cities.

Pollution spikes directly influence demand — especially during Diwali.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................

**Strategic Roadmap:**

Prioritize PM2.5 + VOC filtration technology

Launch in high-AQI, high-population hotspots

Use the Prioritization Quadrant in the dashboard for data-driven decisions

Build awareness campaigns around AQI in non-metro cities

Leverage clean-air policies for growth opportunities
